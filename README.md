# PhD Outputs

Papers, posters, talks and code produced as part of my PhD Candidature at the University of Tasmania and CSIRO Data61.

## Topic

Investigating the capabilities for astronomy-focused radio interferometers to track near-Earth objects and therefore aid in the prevention of debris-forming collisions in space.

During my candidature, I have taken on several roles that extend this topic, including:

* An internship with [Silentium Defence](https://www.silentiumdefence.com.au/our-solutions/maverick-s-series/), analysing the performance of their passive radar observatory as applied to space junk tracking.
* Casual work as a telescope operator for the [AuScope array](https://auscope.phys.utas.edu.au), driving VLBI observations for astronomy and geodesy.
* Contract work as a software developer for the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/physics/space-tracking), developing real-time HPC software for satellite detection and Doppler-based location using single-dish inputs.
* Volunteer contribution to Open Source software and standards in the field of VLBI, including a global study on the use of the VDIF data format.
